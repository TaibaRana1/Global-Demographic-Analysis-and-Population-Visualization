# Global-Demographic-Analysis-and-Population-Visualization

1. Introduction
This case study focuses on analyzing global demographic patterns using a publicly available dataset
from the United Nations Population Division [?]. The study examines population growth, fertility,
mortality, life expectancy, migration, and age distribution across countries and regions. The objective
is to generate informative visualizations and derive insights that can guide policy-making and
demographic planning.

2. Problem Statement
Countries around the world experience diverse demographic trends. Some face rapid population
growth, straining resources and infrastructure, while others experience stagnation or decline, often
with an aging population. Fertility rates, mortality, and migration patterns are the key factors
influencing these trends. The main questions are:
• Which countries are growing fastest, and which are declining?
• How do fertility, mortality, and migration affect population growth?
• Are there correlations between development level, employment, and demographic trends?
• What patterns exist in age distribution and gender balance across regions?


3. Objectives
The objectives of this case study are:
• Identify population trends across countries and regions.
• Examine drivers of population change: birth rates, death rates, and migration.
• Highlight demographic patterns such as median age, life expectancy, and sex ratios.
• Understand the potential reasons for trends in population growth or decline.
• Provide a foundation for future predictive analysis and visualization.


4. Scope and Background of Dataset
This study covers:
• All countries and regions globally, using the UN World Population Prospects dataset[1].
• Demographic indicators such as total population, fertility, mortality, life expectancy, migration,
and age/sex distribution.
• Time-based comparisons focusing on population changes over recent yea
